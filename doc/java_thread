- Basic threading
    - Concurrent programming allows you to partition a program into separate, independently running tasks.

- Defining tasks
    - simply implement Runnable and write a run() method to make the task do your bidding

- Thread class
    - A Thread constructor only needs a Runnable object 
    - Thread t = new Thread(new LiftOff()); t.sart();
