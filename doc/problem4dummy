# Docker

- proxy issue: can't reach docker repo (so sad)
  - please double check /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf 
 
        ```
        $ sudo docker run hello-world
        Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
        docker: Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: Couldn't connect: Connection refused.
        ```

# Spring Boot/Cloud

- Annotation can't be loaded properly(like @RestController)
  - SpringApplication is not on top level of the project

    ```
    # loading UserApplication in this project may cause the missing parse in the other folders
    # note: Application.java should be always placed in the top level 
    ---config
      --> WebConfig.java
    ---controller
      --> UserController.java
    ---user
      --> UserApplication.java
    ```
