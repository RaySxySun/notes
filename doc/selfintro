My name is Sun Xiang Ying (Ray) and I am from China. I graduated from University of New South Wales in 2013. 




My name is XXX and I am from Chennai. I am currently studying Finance and Economics at Hong Kong University. I was
raised in Bengalu and when I was 18 I moved to Hong Kong to take my university study. Last year I went to London to join
the school's exchange program. During my exchange I went backpacking with other backpackers from all over the world to
other countries across Europe. It was a fun experience. I think I have been fortunate enough to be able to live in
different parts of the world and thus be able to broaden my horizon.

I have a strong interest in banking and financial services industry. The reason is I'd like to leverage my
detail-oriented mind and apply the skills and knowledge that I have attained throughout my degree courses. I see myself
as a people-oriented and over-achiever person. I demonstrated this through working in various group projects with
different types of people in which I had been able to perform well.

I would like to be part of your company to further develop myself in banking field and to use my capabilities to serve
both your company and your clients.

(Note: all locations here are fiction, the rest is based on my factual experience even though some parts have been
distorted a little bit. The purpose is just to let you know a structure of self-introduction that I think is good and
appropriate.)
