### Chapter 8 Elementary UDP Sockets

- UDP is a connectionless, unreliable, datagram protocol,
  quite unlike the connection-oriented, reliable byte stream provided by TCP.
  - the client just sends a datagram to the server
  - the server returns the protocal addr of the client, along with the datagram.
